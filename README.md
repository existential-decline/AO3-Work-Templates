This is a simple Tampermonkey javascript add-on that allows users to save, load, and delete templates for AO3 new works.

To install, have <a href="https://www.tampermonkey.net">Tampermonkey</a> installed in your browser, then go to the <a href="https://github.com/existential-decline/AO3-Work-Templates/raw/refs/heads/main/AO3-Work-Templates.user.js">raw userscript</a> page.

<h1>How to Use</h1>
Fill in the textbox to designate a name for a new template, then press the 'Create' button.
Select a saved template in the drop-down and either 'Load' or 'Delete' it.

(Currently, creating a new template with the same name as an old template overwrites it.)
